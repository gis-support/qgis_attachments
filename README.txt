What's Next:

  * Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin
    directory

  * Compile the resources file using pyrcc5

  * Run the tests (``make test``)

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file: ``AttachmentControlWidget.py``

  * Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png

    you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)
